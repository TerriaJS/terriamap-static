HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE","text":"<p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.</p> <p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.</p> <p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.</p> <p>All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.</p> <pre><code>Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.</p> <p>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1     is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.</p> <p>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.</p>"},{"location":"acknowledgements/attributions/#b-terms-and-conditions-for-accessing-or-otherwise-using-python","title":"B.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p> <pre><code> Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n material as expected.

More considerations for licensors:\nwiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.</p> <p>Section 1 -- Definitions.</p> <p>a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is      synched in timed relation with a moving image.</p> <p>b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p> <p>c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar      Rights.</p> <p>d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international      agreements.</p> <p>e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.</p> <p>f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public      License.</p> <p>g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.</p> <p>h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights      under this Public License.</p> <p>i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material      available to the public including in ways that members of the      public may access the material from a place and at a time      individually chosen by them.</p> <p>j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.</p> <p>k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.</p> <p>Section 2 -- Scope.</p> <p>a. License grant.</p> <pre><code>   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n      the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n           in part; and\n\n        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n      its terms and conditions.\n\n   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n      6(a).\n\n   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n      (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n   5. Downstream recipients.\n\n        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n           Public License.\n\n        b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n           Material.\n\n   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n</code></pre> <p>b. Other rights.</p> <pre><code>   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n      Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n      Public License.\n\n   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n      reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n</code></pre> <p>Section 3 -- License Conditions.</p> <p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.</p> <p>a. Attribution.</p> <pre><code>   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n      form), You must:\n\n        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n           with the Licensed Material:\n\n             i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                Material and any others designated to receive\n                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                designated);\n\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n\n           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                warranties;\n\n             v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                extent reasonably practicable;\n\n        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n           retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n           Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n           hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n      information.\n\n   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n      reasonably practicable.\n\n   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n      License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n      Material from complying with this Public License.\n</code></pre> <p>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</p> <p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p> <p>a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial      portion of the contents of the database;</p> <p>b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and</p> <p>c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p> <p>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p> <p>a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p> <p>b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p> <p>c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and      waiver of all liability.</p> <p>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.</p> <p>a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License      terminate automatically.</p> <p>b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under      Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p> <pre><code>   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n      violation; or\n\n   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n of this Public License.\n</code></pre> <p>c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so      will not terminate this Public License.</p> <p>d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public      License.</p> <p>Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.</p> <p>a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p> <p>b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p> <p>Section 8 -- Interpretation.</p> <p>a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully      be made without permission under this Public License.</p> <p>b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and      conditions.</p> <p>c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the      Licensor.</p> <p>d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p> <p>=======================================================================</p> <p>Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Limitations on Grant Scope</p> <pre><code> The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\n License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\n or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\n 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\n a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party\u2019s\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\n    Contributions.\n\n This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\n logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\n notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n</code></pre> <p>2.4.

Fair Use</p> <pre><code> This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\n copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n</code></pre> <p>2.7. Conditions</p> <pre><code> Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n Section 2.1.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Responsibilities</li> </ol> <p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p> <pre><code> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n restrict the recipients\u2019 rights in the Source Code Form.\n</code></pre> <p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p> <pre><code> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n    as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n    Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n    reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n    of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n    or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n    the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\u2019\n    rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n</code></pre> <p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p> <pre><code> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n</code></pre> <p>3.4. Notices</p> <pre><code> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n</code></pre> <p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p> <pre><code> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n jurisdiction.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</li> </ol> <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to    understand it.</p> <ol> <li>Termination</li> </ol> <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,      if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some      reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.      Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an      ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by      some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of      non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become      compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p> <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,      and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or      indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and      all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License      shall terminate.</p> <p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to      termination shall survive termination.</p> <ol> <li>Disclaimer of Warranty</li> </ol> <p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an \u201cas is\u201d basis, without    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License    except under this disclaimer.</p> <ol> <li>Limitation of Liability</li> </ol> <p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such    party\u2019s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p> <ol> <li>Litigation</li> </ol> <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall    prevent a party\u2019s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p> <ol> <li>Miscellaneous</li> </ol> <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe    this License against a Contributor.</p> <ol> <li>Versions of the License</li> </ol> <p>10.1. New Versions</p> <pre><code>  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n  publish new versions of this License.

Limitations on Grant Scope</p> <pre><code> The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\n License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\n or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\n 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\n a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party\u2019s\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\n    Contributions.\n\n This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\n logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\n notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n</code></pre> <p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p> <pre><code> No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\n (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\n under the terms of Section 3.3).\n</code></pre> <p>2.5. Representation</p> <pre><code> Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\n are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\n rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n</code></pre> <p>2.6. Fair Use</p> <pre><code> This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\n copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n</code></pre> <p>2.7. Conditions</p> <pre><code> Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n Section 2.1.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Responsibilities</li> </ol> <p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p> <pre><code> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n restrict the recipients\u2019 rights in the Source Code Form.\n</code></pre> <p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p> <pre><code> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n    as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n    Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n    reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n    of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n    or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n    the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\u2019\n    rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n</code></pre> <p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p> <pre><code> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n</code></pre> <p>3.4. Notices</p> <pre><code> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n</code></pre> <p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p> <pre><code> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n jurisdiction.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</li> </ol> <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to    understand it.</p> <ol> <li>Termination</li> </ol> <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,      if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some      reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.      Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an      ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by      some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of      non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become      compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p> <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,      and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or      indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and      all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License      shall terminate.</p> <p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to      termination shall survive termination.</p> <ol> <li>Disclaimer of Warranty</li> </ol> <p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an \u201cas is\u201d basis, without    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License    except under this disclaimer.</p> <ol> <li>Limitation of Liability</li> </ol> <p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such    party\u2019s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p> <ol> <li>Litigation</li> </ol> <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall    prevent a party\u2019s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p> <ol> <li>Miscellaneous</li> </ol> <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe    this License against a Contributor.</p> <ol> <li>Versions of the License</li> </ol> <p>10.1. New Versions</p> <pre><code>  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n  distinguishing version number.\n</code></pre> <p>10.2. Effect of New Versions</p> <pre><code>  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n  the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n  under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n  steward.\n</code></pre> <p>10.3. Modified Versions</p> <pre><code>  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n  version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n  references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n  modified license differs from this License).\n</code></pre> <p>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses       If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With       Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the       notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p> <p>Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice</p> <pre><code>  This Source Code Form is subject to the\n  terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n  2.0.

Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.</p> <p>4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.</p> <p>5) This section intentionally omitted.</p> <p>6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.</p> <p>7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.</p> <p>8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p> <p>9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.</p> <p>10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.</p> <p>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p> <p>14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p> <p>15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.</p> <p>This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E.

A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/mdn/data.git. This software contains the following license and notice below:</p> <p>CC0 1.0 Universal</p> <p>Statement of Purpose</p> <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").</p> <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.</p> <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p> <ol> <li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:</li> </ol> <p>i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,   and translate a Work;</p> <p>ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);</p> <p>iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness   depicted in a Work;</p> <p>iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,   subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;</p> <p>v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in   a Work;</p> <p>vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal   protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,   including any amended or successor version of such directive); and</p> <p>vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world   based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p> </li> <li> <p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p> </li> </ol> <p>a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,   surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.</p> <p>b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties   of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,   including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness   for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or   other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not   discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.</p> <p>c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons   that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation   any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer   disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions   or other rights required for any use of the Work.</p> <p>d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a   party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this   CC0 or use of the Work.</p> <p>For more information, please see http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</p> <p>The following software may be included in this product: mdurl.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.</p> <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p> <ol> <li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:</li> </ol> <p>i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,      communicate, and translate a Work;  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or      likeness depicted in a Work;  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data      in a Work;  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal      protection of databases, and under any national implementation      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such      directive); and vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national      implementations thereof.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p> </li> <li> <p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p> </li> </ol> <p>a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or     the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to     the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the     Work.  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to     this CC0 or use of the Work.</p> <p>The following software may be included in this product: protobufjs.

Understanding these issues will avoid a lot of frustration while trying to add your data to a TerriaJS application.</p> <p>TerriaJS can interface with three broad types if data:</p> <ul> <li>Catalog Group: A group (folder) of items. Different group types allow the contents to be manually specified or to be automatically determined by querying various types of server. TerriaJS can use many different types of servers to populate a group, including CKAN, CSW, WMS, and more. For example, if you define a catalog group that points at a Web Map Service (WMS) server, TerriaJS will query the WMS <code>GetCapabilities</code> when the group is opened and fill the group with all of the layers advertised by the WMS server.</li> <li>Catalog Item: Actual geospatial or chart data from a file or service, in various formats. TerriaJS supports WMS, KML, GeoJSON, ArcGIS MapServer, and many more files and services as catalog items.</li> <li>Catalog Function: A parameterized service, such as a Web Processing Service (WPS).

Unfortunately, many servers still do not support CORS. If you control the server you're trying to access data on, enabling CORS is almost certainly a good idea, and you can read more about how to do it at enable-cors.org.</p> <p>TerriaJS has a trick to allow it to access data from a server even if that server doesn't support CORS: it uses a proxy server built into terriajs-server, which is included with TerriaMap. The idea is simple: we avoid the need for cross-origin support from servers by running a proxy on the same host that runs our app. That proxy can make requests to other servers on our application's behalf. This works because cross-origin restrictions are a security feature of web browsers, not web servers. The proxy makes it look to the browser like the data comes from the same origin. There's nothing dodgy about this. The risks that browsers are defending against by imposing cross-origin restrictions are not present in this scenario.</p> <p>However, by running a proxy server, our TerriaMap server potentially opens itself up to risks. We don't want people to be able to bounce arbitrary requests through our proxy, because that could be used to make (malicious?) traffic look like it is coming from your server instead of from the real source. This is why <code>terriajs-server</code> uses a whitelist of servers that it is willing to proxy for. The <code>allowProxyFor</code> property in <code>devserverconfig.json</code> specifies the whitelist.

The first bin extends from the dataset's minimum value to the first value in this array. The second bin extends from the first value in this array to the second value in this array. And so on. If the maximum value of the dataset is greater than the last value in this array, an additional bin is added automatically. This property is ignored if the <code>Color Column</code> is not a scalar.</p> <code>binColors</code> <code>string[]</code> <p>The colors to use for the bins, each specified as a CSS color string. If there are more colors than bins, the extra colors are ignored. If there are more bins than colors, the colors are repeated as necessary.</p> <code>enumColors</code> <code>EnumColorTraits[]</code> <p>The colors to use for enumerated values. This property is ignored if the <code>Color Column</code> type is not <code>enum</code>.</p> <code>colorPalette</code> <code>string</code> <p>The name of a ColorBrewer palette to use when mapping values to colors. This property is ignored if <code>Bin Colors</code> is defined and has enough colors for all bins, or if <code>Enum Colors</code> is defined. The default value depends on the type of the <code>Color Column</code> and on the data. Scalar columns that cross zero will use the diverging purple-to-orange palette <code>PuOr</code>. Scala columns that do not cross zero will use the sequential Red palette <code>Reds</code>. All other scenarios will use the 21 color <code>HighContrast</code> palette. D3 color schemes are also supported (https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic) - but without <code>scheme</code> or <code>interpolate</code> string (for example - to use <code>interpolateViridis</code> - set <code>colorPalette = Viridis</code>).

This value is magnitude of z-score - it will apply to positive and negative z-scores. For example a value of <code>2</code> will treat all values that are 2 or more standard deviations from the mean as outliers. This must be defined for it to be enabled. This will be ignored if <code>minimumValue</code> or <code>maximumValue</code> have been set</p> <code>zScoreFilterEnabled</code> <code>boolean</code> <p>True, if z-score filter is enabled.</p> <code>rangeFilter</code> <code>number</code> <code>0.3</code> <p>This is applied after the <code>zScoreFilter</code>. It is used to effectively 'disable' the zScoreFilter if it doesn't cut at least the specified percentage of the range of values (for both minimum and maximum value). For example if <code>rangeFilter = 0.2</code>, then the zScoreFilter will only be effective if it cuts at least 20% of the range of values from the minimum and maximum value</p>"},{"location":"connecting-to-data/catalog-type-details/esri-featureServer/#enumcolortraits","title":"EnumColorTraits","text":"Trait Type Default Description <code>value</code> <code>string</code> <p>The enumerated value to map to a color.</p> <code>color</code> <code>string</code> <p>The CSS color to use for the enumerated value.</p>"},{"location":"connecting-to-data/catalog-type-details/esri-featureServer/#tablepointstyletraits","title":"TablePointStyleTraits","text":"Trait Type Default Description <code>enum</code> <code>EnumPointSymbolTraits[]</code> <p>The point style to use for enumerated values.</p> <code>bin</code> <code>BinPointSymbolTraits[]</code> <p>The point style to use for bin values.</p> <code>null</code> <code>PointSymbolTraits</code> <p>The default point style.</p> TableStyleMapTraits <code>enabled</code> <code>boolean</code> <code>true</code> <p>True to enable.</p> <code>mapType</code> <code>string</code> <p>The type of style map.

If true, no part of the dataset will be displayed outside the rectangle. This property is true by default, leading to better performance and avoiding tile request errors that might occur when requesting tiles outside the server-specified rectangle. However, it may also cause features to be cut off in some cases, such as if a server reports an extent that does not take into account that the representation of features sometimes require a larger spatial extent than the features themselves. For example, if a point feature on the edge of the extent is drawn as a circle with a radius of 5 pixels, half of that circle will be cut off.</p> <code>minimumLevel</code> <code>number</code> <p>The minimum level-of-detail supported by the imagery provider. Take care when specifying this that the number of tiles at the minimum level is small, such as four or less.

For large scales set hideLayerBeforeMaxScaleDenominator to true, otherwise you may experience performance issues (requesting too many tiles).</p> <code>minScaleDenominator</code> <code>number</code> <p>The denominator of the largest scale (smallest denominator) for which tiles should be requested. For example, if this value is 1000, then tiles representing a scale larger than 1:1000 (i.e. numerically smaller denominator, when zooming in closer) will not be requested.  Instead, tiles of the largest-available scale, as specified by this property, will be used and will simply get blurier as the user zooms in closer.</p> <code>hideLayerAfterMinScaleDenominator</code> <code>boolean</code> <p>True to hide tiles when the <code>Minimum Scale Denominator</code> is exceeded.

If true, no part of the dataset will be displayed outside the rectangle. This property is true by default, leading to better performance and avoiding tile request errors that might occur when requesting tiles outside the server-specified rectangle. However, it may also cause features to be cut off in some cases, such as if a server reports an extent that does not take into account that the representation of features sometimes require a larger spatial extent than the features themselves. For example, if a point feature on the edge of the extent is drawn as a circle with a radius of 5 pixels, half of that circle will be cut off.</p> <code>minimumLevel</code> <code>number</code> <p>The minimum level-of-detail supported by the imagery provider.

For example, if this value is 10000, then tiles representing a scale smaller than 1:10000 (i.e. numerically larger denominator, when zooming out further) will not be requested. For large scales set hideLayerBeforeMaxScaleDenominator to true, otherwise you may experience performance issues (requesting too many tiles).</p> <code>minScaleDenominator</code> <code>number</code> <p>The denominator of the largest scale (smallest denominator) for which tiles should be requested. For example, if this value is 1000, then tiles representing a scale larger than 1:1000 (i.e. numerically smaller denominator, when zooming in closer) will not be requested.  Instead, tiles of the largest-available scale, as specified by this property, will be used and will simply get blurier as the user zooms in closer.</p> <code>hideLayerAfterMinScaleDenominator</code> <code>boolean</code> <p>True to hide tiles when the <code>Minimum Scale Denominator</code> is exceeded.

The layers are:</p> Name Purpose ThirdParty This directory contains third-party code that is not available via npm packages for whatever reason. Core Low-level utility classes and functions that don't depend on a UI toolkit (i.e. React) or a mapping library (i.e. Cesium or Leaflet). Map Classes and functions to work with or extend a mapping library (i.e. Cesium or Leaflet). This layer should not depend on a particular UI toolkit (i.e. React). Charts Similar to the <code>Map</code> layer, except for charting instead of mapping. This depends on the charting library (D3) but not on React. Models This is heart of TerriaJS. Classes and functions in this layer know how to interface with catalog servers, map servers, and geospatial data formats. Most of the logic of a TerriaJS application is found in this layer. However, it does not depend on React. ViewModels and ReactViewModels Contains classes and functions that are closely associated with the UI but cannot be described as React components or views. These two directories are separate mostly for historical reasons; there is little practical difference between them. ReactViews This is the React-based user interface of TerriaJS. All of the React components are found in this layer."},{"location":"contributing/architecture/#user-interface","title":"User interface","text":"<p>TerriaJS uses the React library as the basis for its user interface. The top-level entry point is StandardUserInterface.jsx. It is expected that most applications will use this standard user interface, but a sophisticated TerriaJS application could use its own version instead in order to allow extreme customization of the interface.</p> <p>For styling, we use Sass in CSS modules loaded via the Webpack <code>css-loader</code>, meaning that each React component imports its own local CSS styles from a <code>.scss</code> file. However in version 8, we will be removing Sass &amp; move toward <code>styled-components</code> - see the frontend style guide</p> <p>The user interface is meant to be a thin layer with minimal domain-specific logic. Ideally, all domain-specific logic would reside in the <code>Models</code> layer or perhaps in the <code>ViewModels</code> layer. This approach allows the UI to be replaced (including by a user of TerriaJS rather than its developers) without needing to re-implement large chunks of TerriaJS logic. In fact, the entire user interface can be viewed as optional. A TerriaJS-based application could replace it with its own custom UI.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/architecture/#observables-and-observemodelmixin","title":"Observables and ObserveModelMixin","text":"<p>Virtually all TerriaJS state is stored in instances of classes in the <code>Models</code> and <code>ViewModels</code> layers. Many changes to this state are initiated by actions in the user interface. For example, the user clicks an <code>Add to Map</code> button and a number of state changes take place that eventually cause the catalog item to appear on the map.</p> <p>Some changes, however, come from elsewhere. For example, when the user drags a JSON catalog file onto the map, this may cause any number of changes to objects in the <code>Models</code> layer. In addition, the <code>Models</code> layer itself is usable as an API for TerriaJS. Developers can add custom user interface components or other functionality that manipulate the objects in the <code>Models</code> layer. It's important that the user interface update to reflect the new state, whether the state change was initiated by the core TerriaJS UI or not.</p> <p>To that end, most of the properties of objects in the <code>Models</code> and <code>ViewModels</code> layers are observable. Near the bottom of the constructor of most model objects (UrlTemplateCatalogItem for example), you'll see a line like this:</p> <pre><code>knockout.track(this, ['minimumLevel', 'maximumLevel', 'attribution', 'subdomains', 'tileDiscardPolicy']);\n</code></pre> <p><code>knockout.track</code> transforms each of the named properties on the given object (<code>this</code> in this case) into an observable property. A Knockout observable property is just like a normal property; you can get and set its value as normal. On top of that, however, an observable property raises an event when it changes. For example, if we have a <code>UrlTemplateCatalogItem</code> instance in a variable named <code>urlTemplateCatalogItem</code>, we can subscribe to its <code>minimumLevel</code> property like this:</p> <pre><code>knockout.getObservable(urlTemplateCatalogItem, 'minimumLevel').subscribe(function() {\n    alert('minimumLevel changed!');\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Many model classes also define computed properties, which are defined using either <code>overrideProperty</code> or <code>knockout.defineProperty</code>. Computed properties have a getter and optionally a setter. The getter is invoked once the first time the property is accessed and the value is memoized (cached). Further accesses of the property will get the memoized value.</p> <p>However, Knockout automatically keeps track of the set of observables (including other computed observables) that were accessed during the execution of the getter. If any of those properties change, the computed observable's getter will be invoked again and the new value memoized. This new invocation may access different observables properties than it did the first time around, and it is those new properties that will trigger any future re-evaluations of the computed property. We can subscribe to change notification on computed properties in the same way we subscribe to regular observable properties.</p> <p>It's rarely necessary to explicitly subscribe to an observable, though. In the React components in the TerriaJS user interface, we use a React mix-in called ObserveModelMixin. When this mix-in is included in a component, the React <code>render</code> method acts a bit like a computed observable. It automatically keeps track of all the observables that were read in the course of rendering the component. If any of them change, the component will be automatically re-rendered.</p> <p>With <code>ObserveModelMixin</code>, in most cases it's not necessary to think very much about the TerriaJS state when developing the UI. Just write your <code>render</code> method as a pure function that produces virtual DOM nodes from the current state of the application, and rest assured that your <code>render</code> method will be called again if that state ever changes in a way that might affect what is shown to the user.</p> <p>For more details of Knockout observables, see Knockout-ES5 as well as the main Knockout documentation.</p> <p>It may seem a bit stange that we're using Knockout, which is itself a user interface framework, in a library that uses React for its user interface. In fact, we're not using the UI or DOM manipulation parts of Knockout at all. We're only using it as an observable library. Knockout's observables are feature rich and well tested, and make a great complement to React when paired with our <code>ObserveModelMixin</code>.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/architecture/#major-components-in-models","title":"Major Components in Models","text":"<p>To help understand the code in Models, here is a summary of some of the major components of TerriaJS:</p>"},{"location":"contributing/architecture/#terria","title":"Terria","text":"<p>The root of the TerriaJS application state.

An item or group in the catalog, for example, is an instance of a class, such as <code>WebMapServiceCatalogItem</code>. Model objects are mutable, meaning we can modify them in-place without the need to copy them first or anything of that sort. This is different from the approach used in Redux, which requires that the application's state be represented with immutable objects and that transitions to new states happen in a very controlled fashion.</p> <p>Unlike most OO applications, though, the TerriaJS model layer is reactive. Virtually all properties in the model layer are declared <code>@observable</code>. An observable property is just like a normal property; you can get and set its value as normal. On top of that, however, an observable property raises an event when it changes.</p> <p>Many classes also define <code>@computed</code> properties. Computed properties have a getter and optionally a setter. The getter is invoked once the first time the property is accessed and the value is memoized (cached). Further accesses of the property will get the memoized value.</p> <p>The interesting part is that MobX automatically keeps track of the set of observables (including other computed observables) that were accessed during the execution of the getter. If any of those properties change, the computed observable's getter will be invoked again and the new value memoized. This new invocation may access different observable properties than it did the first time around, and it is those new properties that will trigger any future re-evaluations of the computed property. We can subscribe to change notification on computed properties in the same way we subscribe to regular observable properties.</p> <p>Rather than directly subscribing to property changes, MobX applications typically use reactions. A reaction, such as one created with the <code>autorun</code> function, is a bit of code that, when it runs, accesses some observable and computed properties and does something, such as modifying the non-reactive Cesium and Leaflet mapping layers. If any of the properties accessed change in the future, the reaction will run again.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/model-layer/#avoid-reactions-and-other-side-effects","title":"Avoid reactions and other side effects","text":"<p>A reaction, as described above, is a type of side-effect. When a property changes, \"something\" happens. That \"something\" may be surprising to whoever wrote the code that modified the property, and so this is an extremely common source of bugs.</p> <p>A good rule of thumb is this: all properties should either be simple data properties (i.e. no getter or setter), or they should have only a getter and that getter should be a pure function of other properties. A pure function is one that can be called any number of times with no observable side effects, and that returns the same value for the same inputs every time it is called.</p> <p>Computed properties with setters should be avoided. In our old architecture, we frequently used computed properties with a setter to model properties that are configurable by the user, but that have a default value computed from other properties when there is no user-specified value. In the current architecture, this is better modeled by:</p> <ul> <li>Defining the configurable property on the <code>Traits</code> class.</li> <li>Defining a computed property on the derived Model class that accesses <code>super.propertyName</code> (if mixins should be allowed to define the property) or <code>this.flattened.propertyName</code> (if only a directly-configured property value should be used) and, if that is undefined, computes and returns the default value from other properties.</li> </ul> <p>If a property does have a setter, it should obey these laws:</p> <ol> <li>You get back what you put in: If you set the value of the property and then get it, you should get back the same value you set.</li> <li>Putting back what you got doesn't change anything: If you get property's value, and then set it with that same value, it doesn't change anything.</li> <li>Setting twice is the same as setting once: There should be no observable effect from setting a property to the same value twice.</li> </ol> <p>Note: These are the Lens Laws from functional programming.</p> <p>We need to be more precise about what we mean by \"same value\" in the laws above. For primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, and undefined), \"the same\" means that comparing the values with <code>===</code> returns <code>true</code>. <code>===</code> should also return <code>true</code> for references to model objects and other mutable, reactive objects. Arrays should be MobX reactive arrays where each element in the array follows the rules stated here.</p> <p>For other types of objects, such as Cesium's mutable <code>JulianDate</code>, <code>Cartographic</code>, and <code>Cartesian3</code> types, \"same value\" means that the instances should conceptually represent the same value (e.g. using the <code>equals</code> function on the two instances should return true), but the instance may be different. In particular, properties of these types should declare their type as <code>Readonly&lt;JulianDate&gt;</code>, <code>Readonly&lt;Cartographic&gt;</code>, or <code>Readonly&lt;Cartesian3&gt;</code>.

This is usually pretty straightforward, but it gets more difficult when one of the two places is part of Cesium, Leaflet, D3, or some other non-reactive part of our application.

For example, an easy way to keep Cesium's list of imagery layers in sync with the TerriaJS workbench is to create an <code>autorun</code> that removes all the layers and then re-adds the imagery layers for all catalog items on the workbench. This would \"work\", but even small changes would cause the globe's imagery layers to vanish and then reload.</p> <p>Instead, Cesium's current state should be modified to match the desired state derived from the workbench. A useful illustration of an extreme version of this principle can be found in how React interacts with the browser DOM. React components produce a desired state of the DOM each time their <code>render</code> method is called. The magic of React is that it efficiently updates the DOM to match that desired state. Fortunately, we are rarely trying to update state that is as complicated as the browser DOM, so we don't need to use techniques as sophisticated as React's.

The only exception to this rule is for highly transient properties, such as whether a load from a remote source is currently in progress.</li> <li>Covariance: If you override a gettable property in a derived class, its type must be covariant with the base class type.

And it is fine if the derived class returns <code>Dog</code> while the base class returns <code>Animal</code>. But it is not ok if this relationship is reversed. You shouldn't really have any settable properties, but if you do, the types of such properties must be identical in base and derived classes.</li> <li>Equals: Pay attention to the comparer/equals to use with observables to determine if a new value is equal to an old one.

Add the complete URL (including <code>.json</code>) to the URL, after <code>#</code>. For instance, <code>http://nationalmap.gov.au/#http://example.com/mycatalog.json</code>.

You may also want to control the caching folder which can be done by editing your geoserver instance as explained here. You will also probably need to set permissions in your new cache folder to 666.</p> <p>The other solution is to put a caching proxy in front of your geoserver instance. This also has the benefit of being able to access your server on port 80 if you wish. The option we recommend is nginx. This is FOSS software and is available as a package on ubuntu. Below is an example of setting up nginx to work with geoserver.</p>"},{"location":"deploying/setting-up-geoserver/#nginx","title":"nginx","text":"<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y nginx\n</code></pre> <p>Then modify the configuration files to point to your server and turn on caching</p> <pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop\nsudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.orig\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>and add this line at the bottom of the http section</p> <pre><code>proxy_cache_path /your/cache/folder/ keys_zone=one:10m max_size=8G;\n</code></pre> <pre><code>sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.orig\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default\n</code></pre> <p>in the servers section, comment out the root and index lines and add this line right after</p> <pre><code>proxy_cache one;\n</code></pre> <p>and replace the location setting in the server section with the following code (replacing my_new_geoserver with your server name)</p> <pre><code>    location /my_new_geoserver/ {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;\n        proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;\n            proxy_redirect off;\n            proxy_buffering off;\n            proxy_set_header        Host            $http_host;\n            proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;\n            proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Now restart</p> <pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start\n</code></pre> <p>And if all went as planned you should be able to access your server at http://localhost/my_new_geoserver/web.</p>"},{"location":"deploying/setting-up-geoserver/#allowing-terriamap-to-access-your-server","title":"Allowing TerriaMap to access your server","text":"<p>Due to security in modern browsers, for TerriaMap to use your service you will probably need to do a little more work. Either you will need to set up your server with CORS support or provide a proxy service for your geoserver to allow TerriaMap access to your data. TerriaMap includes a proxy to some domains by default and if you are in these domains we will provide the proxy service.</p> <p>If you are not in these domains, you will get an cross-domain-access error. To work with TerriaMap without using a proxy, Geoserver must be configured to support CORS. The most common way to do this is to install CORS Filter.</p> <p>An alternative approach, is to add CORS support to your nginx proxy service. See the documentation on how to do this.</p>"},{"location":"deploying/setting-up-geoserver/#moving-your-geoserver-instance","title":"Moving your Geoserver Instance","text":"<p>Moving your geoserver instance to a new location is pretty straightforward.
